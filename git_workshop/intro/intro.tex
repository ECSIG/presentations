\begin{frame}{What is ECSIG?}
  The Engineering and Computer Science Interest Group (ECSIG) is the student
  ACM Chapter at URI. There are a few things that we like to do:
  \vfill
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Projects
    \item Seminars
    \item Workshops (like this one)
    \item Special Events (movie nights, game nights, programming days)
  \end{itemize}

  \vfill
  We're always looking for new members! Come chat on IRC on #ecsig at
  irc.ecsig.com or on the forums at www.ecsig.com/forums.

         or during the practical
   \item Short survey
