\section{The R\'esum\'e}

\begin{frame}{The R\'esum\'e(s)}
  The r\'esum\'e is the main thing that conveys who you are to a potential
  employer. It's vital to keep a few things in mind when building it:

  \begin{itemize}
    \item Keep it updated - check it once a quarter, or just before a job
          search
    \item Keep it brief - should be 1 page
    \item Tailor it for different positions
    \item Don't list everything you've ever done - what's actually important?
  \end{itemize}

  Contact me if you want to see the r\'esum\'e that I use.

\section{The Internship}
\begin{frame}{The Internship}
Obviously this depends greatly on where you work, but you'll notice a few things:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Some form of version control (git or svn most likely)
  \item Code is likely to be messy, and documentation will likely be sparse or
        non-existent

\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[Final Tips]\frametitle{Final Tips}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Ask questions!
  \item Documentation is your friend - find official documentation for the
        language(s) and the framework(s) and use them often
  \item Employers want to hire people that want to be there - you can show that
        in many different ways
\end{itemize}
